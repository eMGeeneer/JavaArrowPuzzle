# Arrow Puzzle from Idle Exponential

The game has two modes: one with a hexagonal grid, and one with a square grid.

Clicking a circle will rotate all adjacent circles as well as itself

A hint button is available at the bottom of the screen which will locate a circle and display the number of times it needs to be rotated.
Each hint adds 10 seconds to the timer.
